## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

The backend server will run on `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

### Windows Agent Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd windows_agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure the agent:
```bash
python -m windows_agent --configure
```

3. Register the device:
```bash
python -m windows_agent --register EMPLOYEE_ID
```

4. Run the agent:
```bash
python -m windows_agent --run
```

Alternatively, use the provided setup.bat script for guided installation:
```bash
cd windows_agent
setup.bat
```

## Usage

### Web Application
1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Click "Start Stress Scan" to begin
3. Allow camera access when prompted
4. Click "Capture & Analyze" to analyze your current stress level
5. View your stress level and personalized suggestions
6. Click "Stop Scan" to end the session

### Windows Agent
The Windows agent runs silently in the background and can be:
- Configured to run at startup
- Installed as a Windows service
- Controlled through commands from the backend
